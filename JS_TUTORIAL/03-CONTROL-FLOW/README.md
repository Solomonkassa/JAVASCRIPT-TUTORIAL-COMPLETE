# Control Flow: Making Decisions

Learn how to control program execution with conditions and loops. This is essential for writing dynamic, responsive code.

## Topics Covered

1. **[If/Else/Else If Statements](./01-if-else.md)** - Conditional execution based on true/false conditions
2. **[Loops: For, While, Do...While, For...In, For...Of](./02-loops.md)** - Repeating code multiple times
3. **[Switch Statements](./03-switch-statements.md)** - Multiple conditions using switch

## Learning Path

```
If/Else → Loops → Switch → Combine All!
```

## Quick Comparison

| Statement | Use Case | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| if/else | Single or few conditions | if (age >= 18) { canVote = true } |
| switch | Many cases, same variable | switch(day) { case 1: ... } |
| for | Fixed number of iterations | for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) |
| while | Unknown iterations | while (input !== 'exit') |
| for...in | Loop object properties | for (let key in object) |
| for...of | Loop array values | for (let item of array) |

## Key Concepts

- **Conditional execution**: Run code only when certain conditions are true
- **Loops**: Repeat code without writing it multiple times
- **Break/Continue**: Control loop flow
- **Nested structures**: Combine conditions and loops for complex logic

## Real-World Examples

- **E-commerce**: If item is in stock → show "Buy" button, else show "Out of Stock"
- **Games**: Loop through all players, for each player loop through their items
- **Validation**: If email is invalid → show error message
- **Data processing**: Loop through array and filter/transform data based on conditions

**Start with**: [If/Else Statements](./01-if-else.md)
