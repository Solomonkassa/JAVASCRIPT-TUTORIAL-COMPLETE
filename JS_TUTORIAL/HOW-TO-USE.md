## Making the Most of Each Section

### Before Reading

1. **Set intention** - What do I want to learn?
2. **Review previous** - What did I learn last time?
3. **Time yourself** - How long will this take?

### During Reading

1. **Read carefully** - Don't skim
2. **Run code examples** - Type them yourself
3. **Take notes** - Write key concepts
4. **Ask questions** - Think critically

### After Reading

1. **Do exercises** - Practice immediately
2. **Try variations** - Modify examples
3. **Explain it** - Teach someone else (or yourself)
4. **Build something** - Use what you learned

---

## Dealing with Difficult Topics

When you hit a tough concept:

1. **Slow down** - Don't rush
2. **Re-read carefully** - Read again more slowly
3. **Watch the video** - Check resources for alternative explanation
4. **Type more examples** - Create your own variations
5. **Ask for help** - Check communities (Reddit, Discord, Stack Overflow)
6. **Move on** - Come back to it later
7. **Don't compare** - Everyone learns at their own pace

**Common difficult topics:**
- Closures → Comes with practice
- Prototypes → Jump to classes first
- Async/Await → Learn promises thoroughly first
- Event bubbling → Build interactive projects
- This keyword → Use arrow functions initially
