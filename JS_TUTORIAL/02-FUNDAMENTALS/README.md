# Fundamentals: The Building Blocks

Master the core concepts that everything else builds upon.

## Topics Covered

1. **[Variables and Data Types](./01-variables-types.md)** - var, let, const, primitive types, objects
2. **[Operators](./02-operators.md)** - Arithmetic, logical, comparison, assignment, special operators
3. **[Type Conversion](./03-type-conversion.md)** - Implicit and explicit type coercion
4. **[Strings](./04-strings.md)** - String methods, manipulation, and operations
5. **[Error Handling](./05-error-handling.md)** - Try/catch, error types, throwing errors

## Learning Path

```
Variables & Types → Operators → Type Conversion 
→ Strings → Error Handling → Ready for Control Flow!
```

## Quick Reference

| Concept | What | Why |
|---------|------|-----|
| Variables | Store data | Reuse and manage values |
| Types | Data categories | Different operations |
| Operators | Perform actions | Manipulate data |
| Strings | Text data | Handle text information |

## Next Steps

- **Beginner**: Complete chapters 1-3 first
- **Intermediate**: Focus on chapters 4-5
- **Advanced**: Review chapters 2 and 6 for patterns

**Start with**: [Variables and Data Types](./01-variables-types.md)

## Key Takeaways

- **Variables are containers** for data that you can reuse
- **Data types matter** because different types support different operations
- **Operators perform actions** on variables
- **Type conversion** happens implicitly but you should understand it
- **Strings are powerful** with many built-in methods
- **Error handling** prevents your program from crashing

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using `var` in modern JavaScript (use `let` or `const` instead)
- Confusing `==` (loose equality) with `===` (strict equality)
- Forgetting to declare variables (always use let/const)
- Not understanding type coercion in comparisons
- Not using proper error handling (try/catch)

## Practice Tips

1. Open your browser's developer console (F12)
2. Type out every example
3. Modify the examples to see what happens
4. Try to predict the output before running code
5. Look for patterns in how JavaScript behaves
